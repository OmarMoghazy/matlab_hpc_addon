KAUST HPC ADD-ON FOR MATLAB
===========================

`KAUST HPC Add-on for MATLAB` allows users to submit their scripts and output files for execution
on the KAUST cluster IBEX from their local computer and to retrieve the 
output results from these clusters. This allows them to free up their local computer, 
and likely to get a shorter turnaround time for their calculations.
